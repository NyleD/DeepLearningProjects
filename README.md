** Personal Notes **
These are my personal detailed notes on the three month deep learning course from Coursera. 

### YOLO Street Objects Detection
- Applied a non-max suppression algorithm to CNN output data, in TensorFlow to classify 80 types of street objects
https://github.com/NyleD/YOLOStreetObjectsDetection

### Trigger Word Recognition
- Implemented 2 layers of a uni-directional GRU neural network with Keras to predict when a user says the word "activate"
- Computed a spectogram for audio data, applied data synthesis with pydub and extracted high level features with a 1D CNN

### Art Generation Neural Style Transfer
- Applied Transfer Learning techniques using the NST paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
- Generated two cost functions to mix the content of one image with a style of another to get a final image

### Face Recognition & Verification
- Using the triplet loss function for face verification and face recognition
https://github.com/NyleD/FaceRecognition-Verification

### Planar Data Classification
- Implemented a 2-class classification neural network, and implemented forward and back propagation  
https://github.com/NyleD/PlanarDataClassification

### Sign Language Detector
- Build and trained a ConvNet in TensorFlow to detect different sign language pictures
https://github.com/NyleD/SignLanguageDetector

### Jazz Music Generator LSTM
https://github.com/NyleD/JazzMusicGeneratorLSTM
- Using a sequence model and LSTM to generate Jazz music!

### Football Kickout Classification
- Determining where the goalie in a football field should kick the ball to get the team possessionDetermining where the goalie in a football field should kick the ball to get the team possession. Used L2 and dropout regularisation techniques to reduce overfitting.  
- Used L2 and dropout regularization techniques to reduce overfitting
