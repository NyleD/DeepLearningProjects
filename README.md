### YOLO Street Objects Detection
https://github.com/NyleD/YOLOStreetObjectsDetection
- Applied a non-max suppression algorithm to CNN output data, in TensorFlow to classify 80 types of street objects

### Trigger Word Recognition
https://github.com/NyleD/TriggerWordRecognition
- Implemented 2 layers of a uni-directional GRU neural network with Keras to predict when a user says the word "activate"
- Computed a spectogram for audio data, applied data synthesis with pydub and extracted high level features with a 1D CNN

### Art Generation Neural Style Transfer
https://github.com/NyleD/ArtGenerationNeuralStyleTransfer
- Applied Transfer Learning techniques using the NST paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
- Generated two cost functions to mix the content of one image with a style of another to get a final image 

### Face Recognition & Verification
https://github.com/NyleD/FaceRecognition-Verification
- Using the triplet loss function for face verification and face recognition

### Planar Data Classification
https://github.com/NyleD/PlanarDataClassification
- Implemented a 2-class classification neural network, and implemented forward and back propagation  

### Sign Language Detector
https://github.com/NyleD/SignLanguageDetector
- Build and trained a ConvNet in TensorFlow to detect different sign language pictures

### Jazz Music Generator LSTM
https://github.com/NyleD/JazzMusicGeneratorLSTM
- Using a sequence model and LSTM to generate Jazz music!

### Football Kickout Classification
https://github.com/NyleD/FootballKickoutClassification
- Determining where the goalie in a football field should kick the ball to get the team possession.
- Used L2 and dropout regularization techniques to reduce overfitting  

### Happy Face Detection 
https://github.com/NyleD/HappyFaceDetection
- Detecting Happy Faces with Keras
